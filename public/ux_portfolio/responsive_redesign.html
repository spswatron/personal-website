        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div>
          For my User Interfaces & User Experiences class, we were assigned the
          task of redesigning a public-facing webpage and improving upon users'
          experiences interacting with this site. I chose to redesign
          <a href="https://www.brauburgers.com/">Brauburgers' home page.</a>
          Brauburgers is burgers and craft beer restaraunt in my hometown, so I
          chose to redesign the page because the I visited this location many
          times growing up.
        </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
        <img
          src="./images/responsive_redesign/brauburgers-full.png"
          aria="Brauburgers' homepage."
        />
        <!-- <br> -->
        <div>
          <h3>Finding Problems</h3>
          The Brauburgers home page is not very intuitive.
          <ul>
            <li>
              When users first land on the site, they aren't provided with
              information about what Brauburgers is, or how to interact with the
              page.
            </li>
            <li>
              The different sections of the page do not have clear headers.
            </li>
            <li>
              The menu and order images appear to be buttons, but are not
              clickable.
            </li>
            <li>
              The links on the navbar are confusing, so menu and delivery
              information is harder to find.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Brauburgers description is written in bold face, making
              reading the description feel agressive.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <div>
          After inspecting this site's accessibility using WebAIM WAVE, I found
          the following issues:
          <ul>
            <li>One traditional image was missing alternative text.</li>
            <li>
              One spacer image (an image used mostly for layout) was missing
              alternative text as well.
            </li>
            <li>
              A &lt;noscript&gt; tag was present on the site, which means there
              may be less of a focus on the scripted content's accessibility.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Part 2: Visual Redesign</h2>
        Based on the problems I observed, I created low-fidelity wireframes, a
        visual design style guide, and high-fidelity prototypes for a redesigned
        version of Brauburgers' homepage.
        <h3>Low-fidelity Wireframing</h3>

        <h2>Part 3: Responsive Redesign</h2>
        <div>
          Using my protoypes as reference, I created a responsive and redesigned version of Brauburger's home page. You can access it <a href="./redesigned_brauburgers.html">here!</a>
