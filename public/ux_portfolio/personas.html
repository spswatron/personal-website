        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div>
          In order to better understand users’ experiences interacting with a
          microwave of the make I sketched above, I observed three different
          individuals as they used this device while in public view then asked
          them questions about their experiences. Afterwards, I created empathy
          maps describing user personas and a storyboard portraying a possible
          way users might use this device.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Observations</h2>
        <div>
          I observed three different users using the microwave to heat up rice
          originally in a plastic tupperware. From this, I observed the
          following:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Users do not use the top half of the microwave's control panel,
              except to check the time.
            </li>
            <li>
              While waiting for the microwave to finish, users spent a
              noticeable amount of time looking through the microwave window but
              also on occasion looked at their phone.
            </li>
            <li>
              From my observations, the only buttons users used were "Start,"
              "Stop," and "1."
            </li>
            <li>
              Some users put the rice in a different container before inserting
              it into the microwave, while others left it in a plastic
              tupperware.
            </li>
            <li>
              With little inspection, users knew to pull the microwave's door
              handle and put the food they want to heat up inside the cooking
              chamber.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Interview Responses</h2>
        <div>
          <div>
            After I observed the users, I asked each of them a few follow-up
            questions. Below are the questions I asked, as well as a summary of
            users' responses.
          </div>
          <br />
          <b
            >If you could choose, would you want the microwave window to be more
            or less see-through?
          </b>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Across the board, users said they would prefer for the microwave
                window to be more see-through.
              </li>
              <li>
                They cited their safety concerns with using the microwave (i.e.,
                if the food inside starts to smoke), and that more visibility
                would always be preferable to them.
              </li>
              <li>
                They also cited a general sense of anticipation during the
                waiting process that would be assuaged by the microwave window
                being more see-through.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <b
            >How do you know what button to press with the microwave/how long to
            press it?
          </b>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                All three users said that they pressed buttons based on how long
                they wanted to leave food in the microwave.
              </li>
              <li>
                They each had a different time in mind (1 minute, 1.5 minutes,
                and 2 minutes), but all three said they pressed buttons with
                with the intention of heating food for their specified amount of
                time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Users found the numbers in the control panel to be intuitive, as
                well as the "Start/Add 30 seconds" button.
              </li>
              <li>
                The users who used the "Start" button to set time cited their
                past experience with different microwaves and clicking on
                "Start," while the user who used the number panel cited a
                similar experience but with the number section on a microwave
                they were familiar with.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <b>How do you know whether an item is microwave-safe? </b>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Users said they did not know whether an item was microwave-safe
                based on any information inherently on the microwave itself, but
                based on prior knowledge gained by hearsay and personal
                experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                They cited quotes their parents told them, as well as mishaps
                that occured when they put microwave-unsafe containers within
                the microwave.
              </li>
              <li>
                They all said they decided whether an item was based safe based
                on the container rather than the food itself.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <b>
            If smoke were to start emerging from the microwave what would be
            your go-to procol?
          </b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Each user had a different plan—to cover the microwave with a wet
              towel, bring out a fire-extinguisher, or even just unplug the
              microwave.
            </li>
            <li>
              Users cited their understanding of fires in general, rather than
              instructions on the microwave, as the source of their plan.
            </li>
            <li>
              Users often riffed off their plans, and improvised as they went.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <b
            >If you were to use the "potato" switch on the microwave, how
            prepared do you think the potato should be before inserting it into
            the microwave?
          </b>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Many users said they did not even notice this switch on the
                microwave until I asked this question.
              </li>
              <li>
                They said they assumed the potato switch would be used for an
                unrefridgerated potato, as this was how they most commonly
                observed the tuber in their own lives.
              </li>
              <li>
                They said there was no specification indicating this for them on
                the microwave, but just their preconceived notions about the
                labels/titles of microwave buttons.
              </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>User Personas</h2>
        <div>
          After observing users I constructed two different user personas:

          <figure>
            <img src="./images/personas/cramming_charles.png" />
            <figcaption>
              <b>Fig 2.</b> This persona is for a user who cannot discern how
              long it will take to heat up food for whom there is already a
              button on the microwave (a potato). This persona represents the
              users I interviewed because users generally did not look at the
              top half of the control panel, and were taken aback when I pointed
              out that there was a "potato" button, whose functionality is still
              opaque.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/personas/insistent_iris.png" />
            <figcaption>
              <b>Fig 3.</b> My second persona is for a user who is insistent
              about the amount of time it would take to heat up food with the
              microwave, and so might cause their food to smoke. This represents
              how the users I interviewed didn't have a unified protocol for
              handling smoke from a microwave, or a clear idea of how long to
              leave food in the microwave.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Storyboard</h2>
        <div>
          Given these personas, I made a storyboard for my second persona
          (Insistent Iris). This storyboard considers a user's experience using
          a microwave, in particular if they are already familiar with the
          microwave, as the individuals I observed were. Given that while
          constructing the user persona I kept potential interface problems in
          mind, Iris's journey with the microwave has some bumps, but contains
          the full arc of a user attempting to use this device.

      Thanks for reading! I hope this portfolio entry helped clarify users'
      experiences with this particular microwave!
