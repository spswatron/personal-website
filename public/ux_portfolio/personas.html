            <div>
                In order to better understand usersâ€™ experiences interacting with a microwave of the make I sketched above, I observed three different individuals as they used this device while in public view then asked them questions about their experiences. Afterwards, I created empathy maps describing user personas and a storyboard portraying a possible way users might use this device.

                Key Observations
            </h2>
            <div>
                I observed three different users using the microwave to heat up rice originally in a plastic tupperware. From this, I observed the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Users do not use the top half of the microwave's control panel, except to check the time.</li>
                    <li>While waiting for the microwave to finish, users spent a noticeable amount of time looking through the microwave window.</li>
                    <li>From my observations, the only buttons users used were "Start," "Stop," and "1."</li>
                    <li>Some users put the rice in a different container before inserting it into the microwave, while others left it in a plastic tupperware.</li>
                    <li>With little inspection, users knew to pull the microwave's door handle and put the food they want to heat up inside the cooking chamber. </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

                Interview Responses
            </h2>
            <div>
                <div>
                    After I observed the users, I asked each of them a few follow-up questions. Below are the questions I asked, as well as a summary of users' responses.
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>If you could choose, would you want the microwave window to be more or less see-through?
                        </b>
                        <div>
                            <br>
                            Across the board, users said they would prefer for the microwave window to be more see-through. They cited their safety concerns with using the microwave (i.e., if the food inside starts to smoke), and that more visibility would always be preferable to them. They also cited a general sense of anticipation during the waiting process that would be assuaged by the microwave window being more see-through.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>How do you know what button to press with the microwave/how long to press it?
                        </b>
                        <div>
                            <br>
                            All three users said that they pressed buttons based on how long they wanted to leave food in the microwave. They each had a different time in mind (1 minute, 1.5 minutes, and 2 minutes), but all three said they pressed buttons with with the intention of heating food for their specified amount of time. Users found the numbers in the control panel to be intuitive, as well as the "Start/Add 30 seconds" button. The users who used the "Start" button to set time cited their past experience with different microwaves and clicking on "Start," while the user who used the number panel cited a similar experience but with the number section on a microwave they were familiar with.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>How do you know whether an item is microwave-safe?
                        </b>
                        <div>
                            <br>
                            Users said they did not know whether an item was microwave-safe based on any information inherently on the microwave itself, but based on prior knowledge gained by hearsay and personal experience. They cited quotes their parents told them, as well as mishaps that occured when they put microwave-unsafe containers within the microwave. They all said they decided whether an item was based safe based on the container rather than the food itself.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>If you were to use the "potato" switch on the microwave, how prepared do you think the potato should be before inserting it into the microwave?
                        </b>
                        <div>
                            <br>
                            Many users said they did not even notice this switch on the microwave until I asked this question. They said they assumed the potato switch would be used for an unrefridgerated potato, as this was how they most commonly observed the tuber in their own lives. They said there was no specification indicating this for them on the microwave, but just their preconceived notions about the labels/titles of microwave buttons
