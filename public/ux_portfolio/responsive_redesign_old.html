        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div>
          For my User Interfaces & User Experiences class, we were assigned the
          task of redesigning a public-facing webpage and improving upon users'
          experiences interacting with this site. I chose to redesign the home
          page of Brauburgers' website. Brauburgers is a sit-down burger place
          and is not a chain, so it doesn't have dedicated designers working on
          its Web pages.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
        <h3>Picking a Web page</h3>
        <div>
          You can find the original home page of Brauburgers' website
          <a href="https://www.brauburgers.com/">here</a>. I chose to redesign
          this page since this is a restaraunt I've frequented quite often
          growing up, and for this reason I wish its web interface had a much
          better user experience.

          Beyond this initial screenshot, here are a few more views of this
          webpage, as a user scrolls all the way down:

        <h3>Finding Problems</h3>
        <div>
          I found that Brauburgers' site was not very intuitive to use, and
          could be improved in the following areas:
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Making the site's purpose more understandable</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When landing on the page, there is little text explaining what
              Brauburgers' is, or how to interact with the site. Instead we only
              see a large image with very little context.
            </li>
            <li>
              The menu and order images appear to be buttons, but they are not
              clickable.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is a "See You At The Brau" button actually just makes the
              "See You At the Brau" image expand, and has no additional
              functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
              When we do reach Brauburgers' description much further down in the
              page, the description is in bold face, making reading the
              description feel much more agressive.
            </li>
            <li>Navbar confusing</li>
            <li>
              The different sections of the page are often not labeled
              carefully, such as the about us/description section being called
              "Craft Burgers & Beer."
            </li>
            <li>
              In addition, the font size of Brauburgers' description is quite
              small, make it less legible to certain users.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <div>
          While inspecting this site's accessibility, I found the following
          issues:
          <ul>
            <li>One traditional image was missing alternative text.</li>
            <li>
              One spacer image (an image used mostly for layout) was missing
              alternative text as well.
            </li>
          </ul>
          One warning I also received was that a &lt;noscript&gt; tag was
          present on the site. Often the contents within &lt;noscript&gt; tags
          are used to present an accessible version of an inaccessible site, but
          we should still ensure that the scripted content is accessible as
          well.
